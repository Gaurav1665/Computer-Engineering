			<p class="name">Nike Kyrie Infinity By You</p>
			<p class="mrp"><b>MRP-14,995</b></p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				-  The faster Kyrie slows down, the quicker he can speed up or change direction. His ability to control his movement keeps defenders guessingâ€”and him in control. The Kyrie Infinity By You provides a tight custom fit, enhanced responsiveness in the forefoot and next-gen traction, allowing players to accelerate and decelerate on demand and take advantage of the separation they create in a style that's all about you and your game.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				<b>Mix And Match Your Swagger</b>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				With a vast collection of different colours to choose from, you can make your shoes match with the same colour or go brash and mix them up for each shoe individually. Pick your own Kyrie logo and personalise a message on the lateral collar of each shoe. The performance of the shoe will have your opponent guessing throughout the game. The colour schemes will leave them impressed.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				<b>Feel Secure and Connected</b>
			</p>
			<P class="paragraph">
				Kyrie likes his shoes to feel tight and custom fitted like a boxing glove. Dynamic internal bands peep through the upper, and the laces feed through them. Tightening the laces pulls down on the bands to create a super-snug, comfortable and connected fit.
			</P>
			<p class="paragraph">
				<b>Feel the Court, Unlock Your Energy</b>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				An updated 3-layer cushioning system features an ultra-responsive Air Zoom unit in the forefoot, sandwiched between a moulded sockliner and a soft, stable foam midsole. Less foam and fewer layers improve court feel and unlock the Zoom's energy-returning potential.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				<b>Speed Up, Slow Down and Cut with Control</b>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				Edgy, multi-directional tread is designed around how Kyrie cuts and jabs on the court, providing traction precisely where it's needed. The grippy rubber wraps up the sides, supporting you in and out of the cut. Choose from translucent, solid or XDR options so you stay in control when banking and changing directions.
