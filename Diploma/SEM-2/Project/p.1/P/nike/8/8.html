			<p class="paragraph">
				-  Our lightest racing shoe, the Nike ZoomX Streakfly is all about the speed you need to take on the competition in a mile, 5K or 10K race. Low profile with sleek details, it feels like it disappears on your foot to help you better connect with the road on the way to your personal best. Pops of bright colour add a fun refresh, so you can turn heads at the finishing line.

			<p class="paragraph">
				Full-length ZoomX midsole provides the ultimate lightweight responsiveness. The foam stack heights are lower than the Vaporfly, saving weight and giving you a more aggressive feel. The result is a shoe so light it disappears on your foot, while still giving you the responsive protection of ZoomX foam, helping you reach your fastest pace throughout the turns and accelerations of any race.
