Networking Devices

OSI Layers

1. MODEM:
	works on physical level, convert digital signal to analog signal
	two types : i)DSL(Digital subscribe Line) ii)ADSL(Asymmetric DSL)

2. NIC (Network Interface Card):
	allows device to connect to the internet
	supports wired and wireless
	use MAC to identify device on the network
	works on Data Link level

3.Repeater:
	receive and retransmit the signal
	works on physical level
	two types of repeater: wired and wireless
	wired repeater has only two ports for receive and other for transmit
	
4.HUB ():
	multiport device to transfer data multiple devices
	works on physical level
	types: 
		passive: works as a mediator, only pass the data
		active: pass the data also boost and clear it
		intelligent: works as network management and congestion control
	used in LAN only

5.Switch:
	telecommunication device, only sent to specific device
	works on Data Link level
	also known as multiport bridge.
	switch does not know which device is connected to which device
	switch broadcast the data to get port no and MAC address.
	it is also multiport
